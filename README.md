# portfolio


## I did the following steps to complete my portfolio project
> Created a HTML strucutre in HTML file and added `lang` attribute.
For making my site responsive, added `<meta>` tag along with `viewport' attribute 
> Created different areas like header, banner, cards by using semantic tags like `header`, `section`.
> Applied few styles for those elements by using external CSS (`css.style.css`).
>Downloaded few images and placed those images in a folder named `images`.
>Declared those images in `index.html` by using `<img>` tag along with `src` and `alt`.
